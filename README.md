# Fable.Chessie

## Railway Oriented Programming (ROP)

In F# land ROP (Railway Oriented Programming) is quite popular. One can find all the related stuff [here](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/). This libray is to bring those goodies to Java Script land. Thanks to Fable that is very much possible.

## Chessie

This project is *rip off* of project [Chessie](http://fsprojects.github.io/Chessie/) . That is quite popular in F# land. Basically all ther server specific stuff, C# support is removed. And also provide support of *Chessie specific Result Type* along side of *F# Result Type* . It can be used in any Fable and/or JavaScript project.

You can find detailed documentation of how to use it over (chessie official page)[http://fsprojects.github.io/Chessie/] . One can use everything mentioned there thanks to awesome [Fable](http://fable.io/) support.
